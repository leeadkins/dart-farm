# Dart Farm

This is an experiment in making a game with Dart and Canvas.

It's a work in progress, and nothing really works yet. Reading the code would probably be more interesting than actually trying to run it.

It's all pure Dart and HTML. There is no game engine, other than the simple makeshift one I'm building as I go along and learn. Which, coincidently, is the entire point of this project: to get a better grasp of the art of making web games.

The end result it a type of build-and-wait, resource gathering game. Think Clash of Clans or Farmville, I guess. But in reality, the end result is just to become more familiar and comfortable with building web games.
